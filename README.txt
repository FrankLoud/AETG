Homework 01: README


=== INSTRUCTIONS =========

Files you need:

- main.cpp
- hashtable.cpp
- hashtable.h
- pair.cpp
- pair.h
- makefile

I've included a makefile for this C++ program. Type "make" to compile, and then "make run" to run the program.


=== NOTES =========

My program also includes a number of pieces of code and functions I created to help me debug it along the way. I've commented out these lines, but I left them in to show the work I've done. I've also included the output files my program created for each of the required inputs.
